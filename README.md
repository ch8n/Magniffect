# Magniffect 
App which is helpful for user to zoom into screen

## Issue List: User feedbacks
1. User customizable options 
2. Needs notification toggle and full screen 
3.  + or - zoom needs to be a small 
4. Roller wheel for better fine tune control. 
5. Start up zoom size needs to be user defined
6. Floating widget needs to be user sizable for different screen size phones or just user preference. 
7. Transparency is also needed with position lock on the widget. 
8. This is a much needed tool for vision impaired people and should be standared on every phone. 
9. Magniffect icon from the captured image because it blocks part of the output
10. Snapchat and also in play store. I can zoom in game review images without wasting data on loading them.
11. Only magnifies it's own app
12. It would be great if some of the zooming function can be dynamic.
13. Zoom by holding on the icon and moving it to the area that you want to zoom in to. Or soon as you scrolling up or down the page.
14. Some kind of timer before it starts capturing the screen, so it doesn't catch the dialog that begins it.
15. Need more speed and smooth, no need magnify entire area
16. Big red black logo covering entire area, need more time to minimize it, and select primary app
17. Bagde to big, and should be keep until unloaded.
18. though you can put a editor option to write or erase part of captured picture and a sharing or saving feature , but great work bro hope to see more such work soon .
